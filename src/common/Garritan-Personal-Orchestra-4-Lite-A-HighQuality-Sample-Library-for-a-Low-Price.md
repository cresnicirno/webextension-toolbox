- "Garritan Personal Orchestra is 'Great'. The sounds are clean and has taken my orchestrations up to a professional level." - Stuart Jewett from Sweetwater[^3^]
- "GPO4 rectifies [the absence of real brass ensembles] by incorporating trumpet, trombone and horn sections created by Project SAM, a European company renowned for the quality of their orchestral brass... A useful extra in GPO4 is a small, beautifully in-tune choir who perform nice smooth 'oohs' and lusty 'aahs'... A very useful tool for composers and string arrangers." - Dave Stewart from Sound On Sound[^2^]
- "Considering the low, low price, GPO4 more than delivers with its solid-sounding, highly playable orchestral instruments... It's easy to use, with its text readouts and colour-coding for keyswitching... If you're a reasonable player, you can compose or program quickly whilst achieving the required realism." - Computer Music from MusicRadar[^1^]
