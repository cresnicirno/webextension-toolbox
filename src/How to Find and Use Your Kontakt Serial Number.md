But before you can enjoy the full potential of Kontakt, you need to register and activate it with a serial number. A serial number is a unique code that identifies your product and proves your ownership. Without a serial number, you will not be able to access all the features and content of Kontakt.
 
In this article, we will show you how to find and use your Kontakt serial number, whether you have purchased it from Native Instruments or from a third-party developer. We will also answer some common questions and troubleshoot some issues related to Kontakt serial numbers.
  
## How to Find Your Kontakt Serial Number
 
The way you find your Kontakt serial number depends on how and where you bought it. Here are some possible scenarios:
 
- **You bought Kontakt or a Kontakt bundle from the Native Instruments webshop.** In this case, your serial number is automatically placed in your Native Instruments user account. You can log into [this page](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/my-account/my-products-serials-downloads/) with your Native ID and find a list of all your registered products and serial numbers[^1^].
- **You bought Kontakt or a Kontakt bundle in a physical box.** In this case, your serial number is printed on a registration card inside the product box. You can also find a barcode sticker on the outside of the box displaying a 14-digit number that can be used as a reference[^1^].
- **You bought a third-party Kontakt library from another developer.** In this case, your serial number is usually provided by the developer via email or on their website. You may need to create an account with them or enter your order details to access your serial number. Some developers may also include a serial number card or sticker inside the product box if you bought a physical copy[^2^].
- **You bought a hardware device that comes with Kontakt or a Kontakt library.** In this case, your serial number is printed on a registration card inside the product box. This applies to devices such as Maschine, Komplete Kontrol, Traktor, etc. After registering your hardware device with Native Access, all the software included with it becomes available for download[^1^].
- **You have an older legacy product that uses Kontakt.** In this case, your serial number is found on the serial number card or the installation disk cover that came with the product. If you kept the original product box, you can also find a barcode sticker on the outside displaying a 14-digit number that can be used as a reference[^1^]. Note that some older devices (e.g. Audio Kontrol 1, Kore, Rig Kontrol, etc.) do not require registration[^1^].

## How to Use Your Kontakt Serial Number
 
Once you have found your Kontakt serial number, you need to use it to register and activate your product. This will allow you to access all the features and content of Kontakt and receive updates and support from Native Instruments or the third-party developer.
 
The easiest way to use your Kontakt serial number is to enter it in Native Access, which is an application that manages all your Native Instruments products and downloads. You can download Native Access for free from [this page](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/specials/native-access/).
 
After installing and launching Native Access, follow these steps:

1. In the bottom left of Native Access, click **Add Serial** and enter your serial number.
2. Open the **Kontakt** tab and find your product. If it shows an **Install** button, you can directly install it by clicking on it. If it shows a **Locate** button instead, you have to download the product from the developer's website first[^3^].
